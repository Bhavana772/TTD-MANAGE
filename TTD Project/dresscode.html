<p>
To enhance the spiritual ambience among the devotees thronging to Tirumala to get the darshan of Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy, TTD has introduced traditional dress code in 2013. Initially it was implemented for the pilgrims who are taking part in Arjitha Sevas and now it has been extended to VIP pilgrims seeking break darshan of Lord Sri Venkateshwara Swamy, and general pilgrims who go for Rs.300 and Rs.50 darshan.
