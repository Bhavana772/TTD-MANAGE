Limited number of Devotees is allowed to take part in these weekly sevas on the issuance of limited number of tickets.

<p>Every Monday after second bell the utsava vigraha is brought to the mantapa for 'Chaturdasa kalasa visesha puja' i.e. 14 kalasas. After seeking the permission of Sri Malayappa Swami, ankurarpana and punyaha vachanam is rendered by archakas. As Panchasukatas-Sri,Bhu, Nila, Purusha and Narayana Suktas are recited, Tirumanjanam is performed to the utsava murtis. </br>

<p>
This seva is conducted after the second bell. This ritual was first introduced in Srivari Temple in 1984 on the Golden Jubilee Year of TTD, when a Muslim Devotee offered Lord Srinivasa 108 gold lotuses. The archaka commences the puja by offering dhupa(arti stick) and dipa(lit the lamp) to the main deity. Then he recites the divine names (108) of the Lord. While uttering each name of the Lord, one golden lotus is offered at the holy feet of the lord. On completion of the archana to the Mula Virat, archana is offered to Goddesses Lakshmi and Padmavati. Later Ratha Harati is offered first, followed by ordinary Harati. During this special service, the arjita ticket holders are seated in the Antrala corridor i.e. between the Kulasekhara padi and Bangaru Vakili.

<p>
The Sahasra Kalasa Abhishekam seva is offered to Sri Bhoga Srinivasa Murthi-the silver replica deity of Mula Virat, the processional deities of Sri Malayappa Swamy varu along with his two consorts, Sri Viswaksena-the chief commander of Lord. This seva is performed to the deities after the second bell in the morning at the Bangaru Vakili.The Bhoga Srinivas Murthy is brought outside the Golden doorway and is connected by means of thin silk rope with the Mula Virat inside the Garbhalayam (sanctum). One end of the rope is tied round the feet of the Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy while the other end is placed near the Kathithasta of the Mula Virat, thus symbolically establishing a relationship between the Main deity and the Bhoga Srinivas Murthy to achieve two purposes. Firstly, it becomes clear that Bhoga Srinivasa is representing the Mula Virat and secondly, it makes clear that the Pooja offered to the Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy is nothing but the puja is assumed to have offered to the main deity.

<p>
After the Tiruppavadai Seva, the temple observes some rituals like suddhi (cleaning of the temple) etc., and the Moola Virat is adorned with Velvet Gown from Crown to the Feet and then the main deity is decorated with flower garlands. This service of the main deity being adorned exclusively with garlands is known as Poolangi Seva. The Poolangi Seva is mentioned in the Silappadikaram, the early Tamil Classic in 756 A.D.

Every Friday after Suprabhatha Seva, the regular Thomala and Archana Sevas are done in privacy and then Srivari Abhishekam is observed. This happens to be the most ancient Arjitha Seva that is being observed in the hill shrine of Lord Venkateswara. The Abhishekam starts with water brought from Akasa Ganga Theertham, then with Milk, then with Suddhodakam, Chandanam and other scented articles like powdered Pachcha Karpooram, Saffron paste and drops of civet oil etc., which are brought earlier in the silver vessels.
