                                 <p>Situated at a distance of 12 km from Tirumala and 7 km from Papavinasanam, Thumburu Theertham holds the story of a gandharva who cursed his wife for her laziness. As per the legend, the lady became a toad who had to survive in the pond till sage Agasthya came there with his disciples. While the great sage described the divinity of the pond to his disciples, the toad regained her Gandharva form and hence this teertham began to be called as Tumburu teertham. It is one of the popular places to visit in Tirumala at a distance of 12 km from Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Temple.<br><br>

It can be reached by 7 Kms walk from Papa Vinasanam & Kalyani Dam point through stony path. Generally the route is open to public every year on Palguna Poornima in the month of March. There are about five waterfalls on the way to this place.<br><br>

No food/water is available on the way to this place, so you should carry some.   </p>
