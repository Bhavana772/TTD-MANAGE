                                 <p>At a distance of 4 km from Tirumala Bus Station & 5 km from Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Temple, Srivari Paadalu (also called Tirupada - Holy feet of the Lord) are located at the highest point of Narayanagiri and is situated near to Sila Thoranam. It is one of the important places to visit in Tirumala.<br><br>

As per the mythology this is the place where Lord Venkateswara first set his feet on Earth. The foot print is available here and devotees visit this place at the top of Narayanagiri hill for the divine sight. The beautiful Tirumala temple complex and town is completely revealed from this spot. Near Tirupada there is a garden with a Shiva temple. The Srivari Paadalu now is protected with glass frame on a firm stone platform and pilgrims can't touch the foot prints.<br><br>

The road to this place from the main temple of Tirumala is very scenic with dense forest filled with green vegetation. There are several cabs available to this place from the main temple, both shared and private. Pilgrims have to climb 300 odd steps to reach this divine spot from where a beautiful top view of the temple town 'Tirumala' is very delightful to watch.<br><br>

Timings: 6 AM to 6 PM   </p>
