                                 <p>Situated at a distance of 2 Kms from Tirumala Bus Station & 3 km from Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Temple, Chakra Theertham is the site for a water body near Sila Thornam and is associated with an interesting legend. According to the legend, Lord Brahma wanted to observe penance and to clean this place, Lord Vishnu plunged his Sudershana Chakram, thus creating a crater. It is one of the famous places of sightseeing in Tirumala.<br><br>

Visiting this site is considered as good as touching the Lotus Feet of the Lord, which will deliver the devotees from their travails. The waterfall here is an amazing sight to behold and is the location where the idol of Lord Venkateswara is brought during the Brahmotsvam celebrations.    </p>
