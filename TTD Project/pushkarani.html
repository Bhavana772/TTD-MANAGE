                                 <p>At a distance of 1 Km from Tirumala Bus Station, Pushkarini is a huge lake adjacent to Sri Venkateswara temple. Some pilgrims bathe in Pushkarini before entering the main temple.<br><br>

The Pushkarini was originally in Vaikuntam and belonged to Sri Maha Vishnu. It was set on Earth by Garuda for the sport of Sri Venkateswara. The mukkoti of Pushkarini (the merging of over three crore teerthams in Swami Pushkarini) occurs on Mukkoti Dwadasi (the twelfth day of the fortnight of Dhanur Masa). Therefore, it is believed that bathing in the Swami Pushkarini on this day, is equivalent to bathing in the holy river, Ganges.<br><br>

On the western bank of the Swami Pushkarini is the Sri Varahaswami temple, while on its southern bank is the Sri Venkateswara temple. The wooden-float festival (Teppotsavam) of Lord Sri Venkateswara in the month of February/March and Avabhrudhasnanam or Chakrasnanam during Brahmotsavam takes place in the Pushkarini.    </p>
