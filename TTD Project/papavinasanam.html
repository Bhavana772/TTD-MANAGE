                                 <p>Situated at a distance of 5 km from Tirumala Bus Station & 5 km from Lord Venkateswara Temple, Papa Vinasam is a pretty small waterfall whose waters are treated sacred and have healing powers. As the name denotes, Papavinasam is the place where all the devotees frequent with the belief that a holy bath would redeem them from their sins. Separate dressing rooms are available for both men and women. It is one of the popular attractions in Tirumala.<br><br>

Since the waterfall is gushes from the top of a hill, it looks picturesquely awesome. Access to this lovely falls through the stony footpath also makes your trip quite enjoyable. Another fabulous site is the reservoir of the nearby dam, which restricts the water flow in the pond. A well maintained park and a garden attributes the charm of the scenic surroundings pretty well.<br><br>

There are several cabs available to this place from the main temple, both shared and private. This place needs some walking for 5-10 mins.   </p>
